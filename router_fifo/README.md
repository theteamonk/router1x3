# FIFO
## Functionality
There are 3 FIFOs used in the router design. Each FIFO is 9 bits in width and of 16 locations as depth. The FIFO works on the system clock and is reset with a synchronous active low reset. The FIFO works on the system clock and is reset with a sysnchronous active low reset. The FIFO is also internally reset by an internal reset signal `soft_reset`. Soft reset is an active high signal which is generated by the synchronizer block during the time out state of the ROUTER.<br/>
If `resetn` is low then `full` = 0, `empty` = 1, `data_out` = 0.
